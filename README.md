# Stress Cream Cake

## Ingredients
### A full workload
### Management changes mind on security of a tool so you have to rebuild it last second. Overtime!
### Get almost caught up anyway!
### Your uncles drove all the way up from California. You'll need to visit with them on the weekends.

## Recipe
### 1. Reflect on being only 1.5 weeks behind now instead of 3
### 2. Focus on how much you've learned because that is why you are here
### 3. You WILL get caught up this week
### 4. Ask the terminal if it's mad at you and just **see how long it takes to respond**. *That's how you really know!*
### 5. Don't get distracted by that car alarm.
### 6. Oh wow, that car just got stolen I think
### 7. What are we making again?
### 8. Right, well if it looks like this you did it right!
